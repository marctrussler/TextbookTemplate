<p>If you have taken courses in data science or statistics before you will no doubt have gained a good number of skills to work with data: cleaning, tidying, merging, describing and visualizing data. You may have also have learned (or tried to learn) a confusing set of ideas about hypothesis tests, confidence intervals, and p-values. Because the first set of skills can be complicated and exciting to learn (and we cover those skills PSCI1800 and PSCI3800), hypothesis testing can feel like an afterthought.</p>
<p>The point of this class, what I call an <em>Introduction to Inferential Statistics</em>, is to push this second set of skills – loosely the set of skills that allow us to infer truths about the population from samples of data – to the forefront. Indeed, what I want you to gain from this class is the knowledge that this process of <em>inference</em> is actually the entire point of statistics. Everything we do is in service to this broader point, and everything you know that does <em>not</em> think about things in this way isn’t even really statistics.</p>
<p>To put it shorter: What defines statistics is making conclusions about populations from a sample of data. (We <em>infer</em> things about populations from samples, hence the title of the class.)</p>
<p>What do we mean by “Population”? This is a pretty vague term, and indeed we use it to encompass a really wide range of things.</p>
<p>Sometimes what we mean is very obvious: In politics we often take random samples of a few thousand people to help us to understand the opinions and attitudes of the entire United States. In this case it’s quite clear that the sample is the random sample of people while the population is the adult public of the United States.</p>
<p>But lots of other things in our day-to-day lives are “samples” from some population, we often just don’t consider them as such.</p>
<p>For example: we might be interested in learning about the revenue potential of a small business, and have a few months of their finances as data. The goal is to use this sample of data (which may or may not be perfectly representative!) to better understand what the <em>true</em> earning potential of that business is. In this case the “population” is simply the true earning potential of the business.</p>
<p>If you are sports inclined we can think of the performance of a baseball hitter over a certain stretch of time as a “Sample” from the population that is their true hitting potential.</p>
<p>Another way to conceptualize the “population” is to think of it as a “data generating process”. (Indeed, this is the primary way I think of it). The idea of a “population” fits well to the example of a public opinion poll but not to these other situations like business earnings and baseball hitting. When we think about a “data generating process” we think about there being a fundamental truth that is producing data, but not in a <em>deterministic</em> way.</p>
<p>In statistics, we look to make <em>probabilistic</em> inferences from samples about unknowable truths about these populations/DGPs. We will never precisely know the earning potential of a business, or how many Americans support a presidential candidate, or what level of hitting skill a baseball player has. We can, however, form estimates from a sample of data and estimate our level of uncertainty about the degree to which our answer represents the <em>truth</em>.</p>
<p>Here is a motivating example:</p>
<p>We are going to look at data from 2020 National Election Study (NES), which interviewed just over 8000 Americans in the run up to the 2020 election.</p>
<p>A type of question often asked in survey’s like these is a “feeling thermometer”, where individuals are asked to rate certain groups of politicians on a scale from 0 to 100, where 0 means the respondents feels “cool” towards the object, and 100 means the respondent feels “warm”.</p>
<p>This is how this looks in the first six rows of the data, focusing on the feeling thermometers for Trump and Biden. The first individual rated Trump at 100 and Biden at 0; the second individual rated both candidates at 0; the third rated Trump at 0 and Biden at 65 – and so on as we go down the rows.</p>

<p>You likely have some skills already that may help you to summarize what this sample of data looks like. You have likely learned in previous classes, for example, to look at the distribution of responses to the feeling thermometer question for President Trump, represented as a density plot (which we can think of as a histogram for a continuous variable).</p>

<p>We can see that in our data there is a lot of density around 0, and a lot of density from 80 to 100. What does this mean? This means that in our sample there are a lot of individuals who do not like Donald Trump (give him a rating of 0) and a lot of individuals who have a fairly warm view of Donald Trump (give him a rating near 100). With very few answers around 50, not many individuals have ambivalent feelings towards the former President.</p>
<p>We can also summarize the distribution of this variable in the sample with summary statistics. The mean – or simple average – of this variable, for example, is 40.44. The standard deviation – which can be thought of as how much each individual deviates from the mean, on average – is 40.31.</p>
<p>The problem is that’s not at all what we care about. What we care about, in the example of a Trump feeling thermometer, is how <em>all</em> voters in the feel about Trump, not just the ones in this sample. What is the true average feeling towards Trump amongst all voters? How spread out is that opinion? Do the opinions of Democrats and Republicans differ? All of these questions are not immediately or obviously answered by the data in front of us.</p>
<p>It is tempting to say: well if this is a sample of data from the population isn’t the answer the same in the population? Isn’t it good enough to get a sample, report what’s in that sample, and assume it’s the same as the population?</p>
<p>Let’s think about it this way: if we took another sample of 8000 Americans would this plot look <em>exactly</em> the same? Would we get the exact same mean and standard deviation? Obviously we wouldn’t get exactly the same numbers… But then we can ask: well how much could we expect the mean vary? Is it possible in another sample we might get 45? or 60? or 0?</p>
<p>Let’s return to the baseball example to further think about this. I talked before about how a series of at-bats is a “sample” of the population (or Data Generating Process) which is the hitters true batting ability. (An “at-bat” is one “turn” for a hitter where they get the opportunity to face the pitcher and to try to get a hit.)</p>
<p>Pretend we know that a batter’s true ability is that they get a hit in 35% of at-bats (a .350 batting average). The following code simulates 10000 at bats for this batter. Don’t worry about the nature of this code right now.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb3"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">
<code class="sourceCode R"><span><span class="co">#Generate 1000 at-bats for a .350 hitter</span></span>
<span><span class="fu"><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/Random.html">set.seed</a></span><span class="op">(</span><span class="fl">19104</span><span class="op">)</span></span>

<p>The question we want to understand is: if we take a sample from this data does it necessarily reveal the truth about this batter? So let’s look at different sequences of 20-at-bats (which is about 4 games worth). Afterall, 4 baseball games is a lot of baseball! You should be able to determine whether someone is a good or bad hitter in that time.</p>

<p>The x-axis of this graph is time, and the y-axis is batting average. Every point on this line is a 20-at-bat average. We want to know: to what degree is a sample of data sufficient to learn something about the population/DGP. Remember: the truth here is that this batter gets a hit 35% of the time (a .350 batting average).</p>
<p>Looking at the line <em>sometimes</em> the batter is right on .350, but they are often not. Indeed, there are 4 game stretches where the batter is hitting .100, and 4 game stretches where they are hitting .600, <em>just by random chance</em>.</p>
<p>If our only heuristic is “whatever the sample says is what we believe about the population” then we are going to be wrong <em>a lot</em> when looking at this baseball player over 4 games. The inherent randomness in this data generating process means that we cannot make good conclusions about the skill of this player.</p>
<p>It should be clear that we need an ability to measure and express the degree to which we think we can make conclusions about the truth</p>
<p>Here’s another example from real data. We can go further in terms of the feeling thermometer and look at the relationship between age and feelings towards Trump. Here are those data represented in a scatterplot:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb5"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">

<div class="inline-figure"><img src="Introduction_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png" width="672"></div>
<p>These raw data are a bit harder to parse. Individuals are likely to anchor to certain responses when using the feeling thermometer (0,10,20 etc.) so there is not continuous variation on the y-axis. Further, people at each age have a wide variety of opinions about Trump: there are 20 year olds that love him, and 20 year olds that hate him; there are 80 year olds<a class="footnote-ref" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="&lt;p&gt;There aren’t that many people above 80 in the United States, such that knowing the congressional district, race, and gender of a 90 year old would likely reveal that person’s identity. For that reason, the NES collapses everyone over 80 to be 80 years old.&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>3</sup></a> that love him, and 80 year olds that hate him.</p>
<p>So how can we describe these data? The method that we will focus on in this class is Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression. The red line in the figure represents the OLS estimate for the line that best represents these data. We can further use R to describe this line:</p>

<p>We will learn a lot about what each of these numbers mean, but in short here is what this is telling us. The red line above has a y-intercept of 27.64. This means that when age is 0 (not possible!) the average feeling towards Trump is 27.64. The slope of the line is .24. This means that as age increases by one year the Trump thermometer increases by .24 units. In other words, in these <em>data</em> there is a positive relationship between age and feelings towards Trump. Which checks out given what we know about politics.</p>
<p>But once again, we have a pretty limited interest in describing what is happening in these data in particular. Our real object of interest is the degree to which age and feelings towards Trump are related <em>in the population</em>. If we look at the row for the variable <code>age</code>, the rest of that information is what allows us to understand what this relationship is in the whole population. Things like the “Standard Error”, “T-Value”, and “p-score” are all ways in which we come to understand our ability to make inferences about the whole population based on the information contained in this one sample.</p>
<p>How is that possible? How can we possibly learn something about all the eligible voters in the United States from a sample of a few thousand people? The reason will be explained in detail throughout the course, but the basic intuition is described briefly here. Statisticians have determined that if you were to run the same survey again, and again, and again, hundreds-of-thousands of times; and in each sample record an estimate of interest (such as the mean, or a regression coefficient), the resulting distribution of estimates is extremely predictable.</p>
<p>Here is a quick simulation of what that looks like. All of the code below will make a lot more sense as the class goes on. Try not to focus for the code for now, just the intuition that it is giving.</p>
<p>We can use R to create fake data on which we can run a regression:</p>

<p>Looking at the resulting data, there is a pretty clear positive relationship between these two variables, when x gets higher, we expect y to get higher. Looking at the output of the regression we see that the slope is around 4. This simply means, for these data, as x increases by one unit y increases by 4 units, on average.</p>
<p>Like the ANES data, we know that this is just one possible dataset of many datasets that we <em>could</em> have. Unlike the ANES data, here we know that the population/data generating process is, so we can just actually see what happens when we create new samples of 1000 and run the same regression. Here is one additional sample pulled from the exact same population. To make the point clear, the original data points and regression line are displayed in grey, and the new data and regression line are in orange.</p>

<p>We can see that the new orange data points are not identical to the grey data points. This is new data. But these new data still reveal the same underlying relationship. Because the data points are a little bit different, the <em>regression line</em> is also a little bit different. Looking at the output of the regression we can see that the slope coefficient is slightly different than what we got on with the first sample.</p>
<p>Now let’s go absolutely crazy. Let’s generate 5000 additional samples. That is, we are going to make 5000 independent samples of 1000 people. This is similar to if we re-ran the ANES 5000 times. I’m going to re-sample from this population 5000 times. Each time I’m going to run the regression we have run on the new data and save the slope coefficient.</p>

<p>Displayed in grey is 5000 different regression lines from 5000 different samples all stacked on top of one another. They are all a little bit different but all speak to the relationship in the population.</p>
<p>What does the distribution of these coefficients look like? To understand that we can use a density plot. A density plot is like a continuous histogram. The x-axis shows all the posisble values a particular variable and the y-axis shows how common those value are. Here is what the density plot of all the coefficients from our 5000 samples looks like:</p>

<p>The distribution of these 5000 coefficients, which we will come to learn is called the <strong>sampling distribution</strong> is a bell curve. Indeed, it is actually a special type of bell curve called the <strong>normal distribution</strong> (which I’m sure you’ve heard about).</p>
<p>So to summarize: if we have the ability to magically re-sample the same population many times, and each time calculate some statistic (here, a regression coefficient) we get a normal distribution of coefficients.</p>
<p>Here is the magic/mind-bending part of this. Let’s look again at the very first regression result from the very first sample:</p>

<p>Looking at the line for <code>x.prime</code> we see something called the “Std. Error”. What is truly magic is that this number contains all the information that we need to determine what the sampling distribution woulld looke like if we generated 5000 (or really, an infinite number of samples).</p>
<p>To prove it, I can use R to draw a normal distribution on top of our sampling distribution using only information from that first regression table:</p>

<p>The distribution is identical. Let me repeat what’s happening here. The black line is the distribution of 5000 regression coefficients. In the real world, we can’t just generate 5000 regression coefficients! The orange line is what we predict this sampling distribution will look like based on the results of <em>one</em> sample. In other words: we don’t have to do things 5000 times! We get the distribution from just one sample!</p>
<p>Because we can guess with a great deal of accuracy what this distribution of statistics from repeated sampling would be, we are able to determine how likely or unlikely the result we achieved is under different scenarios (what we call null hypothesis testing). We will learn that the most critical question asked by statistics is: if there is nothing going on here, if there is <em>no</em> relationship in the population, how likely is it to get the result I am seeing in my sample?</p>
<p>If this is all gobblygook right now, do not worry! The big thing to take away from this introduction is the following: <strong>the goal of statistics is to understand the population, not to simply describe the sample we have in front of us</strong>. To gain insight on this, we imagine calculating our statistic of interest many, many times. The resulting distribution is a knowable, calculable thing, which allows us to determine how special our statistic of interest is.</p>
